# Class 15: Looking to the Future: Code 301 Preview and Project Week

<a id="top"></a>
## Today's Plan: Week 7, Monday Lecture... LAST CLASS DAY!

***The Code 301 entrance exam will be published Thursday the 25th. It will be due at 11:59pm on Sunday the 28th. Allow yourself about two hours to complete it. Take your time, be methodical, and kick its butt.***

## Schedule for Today

- Psychological Safety discussion

- Initial team meeting

**Lecture, Part 2: ** 

- Discussion on projects
- Review questions?
- Prep for lab: You will have an assignment to complete as a team, and then you can begin your project planning.





**Announcements**

  - Starting at 6:29pm on Wednesday is a blackout window on submitting classwork (including late assignments and any resubmissions) during Project Week. In other words, you should be **100%** focused on your project during Project Week. But for the rest of the week, do not spend energy on catching up on past assignments.
  - The instructional staff will go into the gradebook and "zero out" any previously unsubmitted assignments today. This is not punitive or permanent (you can still submit/resubmit!), just an administrative step to show you ongoing exactly where your grade stands if you do not submit any additional assignments or do any resubmits of previous assignments.
  - Note that during project week as you submit (or if you don't!) your daily project reports, your course grade will move up or down accordingly.

---

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 15 of Code 201, students will:

- Have an understanding of the fundamentals of Code 301 topics, as measured by observations from the instructional staff during class discussion.
- Have an understanding of how to successfully integrate Git and GitHub into a team code project, as measured by successful completion of the final project.

## Readings

- No readings for today! But keep in mind it is time to start getting into the habit of doing regular daily reading of tech articles, Twitter feeds, and other resources. A great time to do this: on your commute if you bus or train or whatever. And if you drive, there's podcasts! Always Be Learning!
